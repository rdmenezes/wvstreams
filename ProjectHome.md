WvStreams aims to be an efficient, secure, and easy-to-use library for doing network and systems applications development in C++. Both Win32 and Unix-based systems are supported.

This project exists mainly to allow us to track bugs and provide downloads. For more information on WvStreams, please see our [project homepage](http://alumnit.ca/wiki/?WvStreams).
